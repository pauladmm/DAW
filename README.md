All my classwork (Web Application Development)
By subjects:

## Mark-up Language
* **ML_ex1_html**
First exam. Create a web page with plain HTML. Uses with basic syntax, forms an tables
* **pdmm_html**
Html from second exam. This was inspired by [McLibre](https://www.mclibre.org/consultar/htmlcss/examenes/examenes.html).
* **pdmm_style**
Stylesheet for pdmm_html

## Programming
* **Exam1**
First exam with Python. Loops and conditionals.
* **datastructure**
Some workclass playing with data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc. Belong to ['Algoritmos y Programaci√≥n I. Aprendiendo a programar usando Python como herramienta'](https://educacionadistancia.juntadeandalucia.es/centros/granada/pluginfile.php/309652/mod_resource/content/1/Apuntes_Python.pdf)
* **errormanagement**
A procedure called add_once was created. The procedure will add an element at the end of a list, providing that no element must be repeated. If the user of this piece of code tries to enclose an already existing element, a custom exception must be raised. Then another script (request_number) must request a user input until the 0 value is provided. When this happens, the elements provided by the user will be displayed in the same order right before the program end.
* **encoding_text.py**
A little program that encodes a given file to another. Functions and methods for files were used.
* **pdmm_unit8**
The functionality of this programm is make a little database for academic data. Through the command line you can do the following:
-r <textfilename> : load text file, add data into binary file (replacing a existing student when there is a match)
-s <studentname> : show single student data
-m : show list of students with their grades from high to low
-p <mark>: calculate the number of students above the given threshold grade
-a : calculate the average of the grades for the whole class
-o : show students with above average grades

The location of the data file is stored in the first line of a configuration file with the following format:
file = <binaryfilename>
* **pdmm_library**
Is the library where the most of the functions used are stored. It also includes a few custom errors to improve the functionality.

## Data Bases
* **BD_1st**
Summary of what we have done on first term in this subject.
We worked on SQL creating databases, tables and inserting fields (from E/R model). Primary keys and foreing keys were created. 
Users were created and their privileges modified.
