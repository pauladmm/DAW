* **datastructure**
Some workclass playing with data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, etc. Belong to ['Algoritmos y Programaci√≥n I. Aprendiendo a programar usando Python como herramienta'](https://educacionadistancia.juntadeandalucia.es/centros/granada/pluginfile.php/309652/mod_resource/content/1/Apuntes_Python.pdf)
* **errormanagement**
A procedure called add_once was created. The procedure will add an element at the end of a list, providing that no element must be repeated. If the user of this piece of code tries to enclose an already existing element, a custom exception must be raised. Then another script (request_number) must request a user input until the 0 value is provided. When this happens, the elements provided by the user will be displayed in the same order right before the program end.

## Data Bases
* **BD_1st**
Summary of what we have done on first term in this subject.
We worked on SQL creating databases, tables and inserting fields (from E/R model). Primary keys and foreing keys were created. 
Users were created and their privileges modified.
